<h1>Welcome to the Dice Game</h1>

<p>Here are the rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li> Roll the dice to start the game</li>
	<li> If your first roll is a 7 or 11, you win.</li>
	<li> If your first roll is a 2, 3, or 12, you lose.</li>
	<li> Anything else becomes your <em>goal</em>. Roll your goal again before 
		a 7 and you win. Roll a 7 before your goal and you lose.</li>
</ul>
